    "# Basketball Player Analysis: Charles Barkley\n",
    "\n",
    "The Round Mound of Rebound, Sir Charles, and Chuck are some of the few nicknames this basketball great has acquired over the years. One of my favorite basketball personalities as he is very much unfiltered in Inside the NBA with his wild insults to anyone he wants and also having some of the funniest moments on television(His story about getting a bracelet from a guy in steam room always makes my laugh out loud!). So I wanted to do an indepth analysis of his career and how he stacked up with some of the greats that were playing the power forward position. I will also be looking at how he stacks up at the end of his career and also his time on the 1992 Dream Team. \n",
